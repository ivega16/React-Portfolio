        <section class="section-container">

            <p>I am a Data Governance Specialist/Technical Writer at BHG Financial. With a passion for transforming ideas into visually captivating experiences, I am a part of a team dedicated to merging the fields of design and technology.  </p>

            <p>I'm a creative individual with a passion for utilizing technology to create visual experiences that captivate and inspire. I grew up loving art and have always had an eye for design. My technology journey began in college, where I decided to learn how to code on my free time. I soon fell in love with the creative process of bringing ideas to life on different mediums.</p> 

            <p>When I'm not creating, you can find me shopping, at vinyl record shops, traveling, at art exhibitions, or indulging in my love for videography and photography. I believe that creative inspiration can be found anywhere and am always looking for new ways to expand my horizons.</p>
