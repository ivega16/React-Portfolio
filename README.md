# React + Vite Portfolio

This Portfolio provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Description

My motivation was to create a portfolio to showcase my work. I built this project so it could help me organize my work and demonstrate it in an effective way. This problem solves sending in multiple links associated with different projects. I learned how to use logic to meet the criteria associated with making a portfolio.
